## Assignment (in French)

### Le projet

Vous devez cr√©er une interface permettant de faire l'inventaire d'un bureau.
Faire l‚Äôinventaire d‚Äôun bureau signifie juste de compter ce qui est pr√©sent dans le bureau.
Le niveau de pr√©cision d‚Äôun inventaire est illimit√©, si un agent le d√©cide il peut compter le nombre de fourchettes.
Dans le but de garder l‚Äôexercice simple nous partirons du principe que l‚Äôapplication est faite pour g√©rer un seul actif.

### Features √† implementer

-   Ajout d‚Äôun √©l√©ment
-   Suppression d‚Äôun √©l√©ment
-   Le reste est libre

### √âvaluation

Le sujet √©tant tr√®s simple, et la liste de features r√©duite, il est attendu du candidat d‚Äôimpl√©menter les features de bases, puis de laisser libre cours √† son imagination pour r√©fl√©chir √† d‚Äôautres features et les impl√©menter. Les ‚Äúbonus‚Äù attendu sont des features permettant de rendre le projet plus pratique √† utiliser et plus efficace.

Le but de l‚Äôexercice est de juger le niveau technique du candidat, mais √©galement de juger sa capacit√© √† r√©fl√©chir aux diff√©rents cas d‚Äôusages d‚Äôun produit, et de se mettre √† la place de l‚Äôutilisateur final.

Il n‚Äôest pas question de rendre un projet complet pr√™t √† envoyer enprod, √ßa reste un exercice d‚Äôentretien, donc les id√©es les plus complexes pourront tout simplement √™tre pr√©sent√©es √† l‚Äôoral pendant la review du projet.

### Informations
